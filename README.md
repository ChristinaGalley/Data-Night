Group Name: Data Night
Brian Stoffel, Jasmin Pattschull, Tracy Atienza, Christina Galley
## Group topic
Date Night in Rochester, Minnesota

## Data source used for the topic
Google's Places: Nearby Search API

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search-nearby

## Group hypothesis
Can you leave work and get to date night within 10-15 minutes?

## Group's thought on what approach they may want to use for analysis (i.e. what ML technique we may want to use to investigate the hypothesis)
Utilize Google's Nearby Search API to obtain restaurant data within a given distance and use supervised machine learning to predict a restaurant with the best bang for our buck.

## Background
Background: You have dinner plans with your date and just got asked by your head dr. to be on call. There's a chance you may or may not need to work later in the night so you do not want to cancel your plans since you were looking forward to this date. They have agreed to meet you close to the hospital where you work and now you need to find a restaurant within a 15 minute driving distance just in case you need to drive back.

## Data Storage
We plan to store our data in a json format.

## Data Visualization
We plan to visualize our data using Tableau.

The blue bar graph indicates the ratings for each restaurant.  The colored bubbles are sized in relation to the price point of each restaurant. (Example: the bigger the bubble the more expensive the restaurant.  Bleu Duck is the most expensive restaurant.)

Cameo and Bleu Duck both have an overall rating of 4.6 which are the two highest rated restaurants within 1 mile walking distance to SMH.
